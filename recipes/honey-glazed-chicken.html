    <h2>Can you tell we are gearing up for grilling season?</h2>
    <p>It's just basic grilled (or oven broiled) chicken with a fresh mint and<br>
        honey glaze. Nothing to it really, but it tastes fabulous.<br>
        This recipe is set up for whole chicken parts, but you could easily use<br>
        boneless, skinless breasts or thighs; just reduce the cooking time.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Vinegar</li>
        <li>Olive Oil</li>
        <li>Chicken Thighs</li>
        <li>Kosher Salt</li>
        <li>Ground Black Pepper</li>
        <li>Honey</li>
        <li>Water</li>
        <li>Mint</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Marinate the chicken</strong></li>
        <p>Place chicken pieces in a bowl. Mix vinegar with olive oil and pour over<br>
            chicken pieces. Turn chicken pieces so that all are coated with the marinade.<br>            
            Marinate for 30 minutes to an hour.</p>
        <li><strong>Make the honey mint glaze</strong></li>
        <p>In a small bowl mix honey, mint, and just enough water for a good basting consistency.<br>
            Set aside for glazing the chicken.</p>
        <li><strong>Prepare the grill</strong></li>
        <p>Heat the grill to medium high heat</p>
        <li><strong>Season the chicken and grill</strong></li>
        <p>Remove the chicken pieces from marinade. Sprinkle generously with salt and pepper.<br>
            Place chicken pieces on the hot grill, skin side up. Cook for approximately 25<br>
            to 40 minutes, covered, turning every 7 or 8 minutes.</p>
        <li><strong>Baste with the glaze</strong></li>
        <p>For the last 5 to 10 minutes of cooking, baste all sides with the honey mint glaze.<br>
            The chicken is done when the juices run clear (not pink) when a knife tip is inserted<br>
            into both the chicken breast and thigh, and the temperature reaches about 165Â°F.</p>
    </ol>
