        <h2>The best lasagna recipe</h2>
        <p>This classic lasagna is made with an easy meat sauce as the base.<br>
            Layer the sauce with noodles and cheese, then bake until bubbly!<br>
            This is great for feeding a big family, and freezes well, too.</p>

                <li><strong>To Assemble the Lasagna</strong></li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>1/2 pound dry lasagna noodles (requires 9 lasagna noodles - unbroken)</li>

                    </ul>
            </ul>

            <h3>Steps:</h3>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Put pasta water on to boil</strong></li>

                <p>Put a large pot of salted water (1 Tbsp salt for every 2 quarts of water)<br>
                    on the stovetop on high heat. It can take a while for a large pot of water<br>
                    to come to a boil (this will be your pasta water), so prepare the sauce in<br>
                    the next steps while the water is heating.</p>

                <li><strong>Brown the ground beef</strong></li>

                <p>In a large skillet heat 2 teaspoons of olive oil on medium high heat.<br>
                    Add the ground beef and cook until it is lightly browned on all sides.<br>
                    Remove the beef with a slotted spoon to a bowl. Drain off all but a tablespoon of fat.</p>

                <li><strong>Cook the bell pepper, onions, garlic, add back the beef</strong></li>

                <p>Add the diced bell pepper and onions to skillet (in the photo we are using<br>
                    yellow bell pepper and red onions). Cook for 4 to 5 minutes, until the<br>
                    onions are translucent and the peppers softened. Add the minced garlic and<br>
                    cook half a minute more. Return the browned ground beef to the pan.<br>
                    Stir to combine, reduce the heat to low and cook for another 5 minutes.</p>
                <li><strong>Transfer to medium sized pot<br>
                    Add tomatoes and remaining sauce ingredients to build the sauce</strong></li>

                <p>Transfer the beef mixture to a medium sized (3- to 4-quart) pot. Add the crushed<br>
                    tomatoes, tomato sauce, and tomato paste to the pot. Add the parsley, oregano, <br>
                    and Italian seasonings, adjusting the amounts to taste. Sprinkle with garlic powder<br>
                    and/or garlic salt, to taste. Sprinkle with red or white wine vinegar.<br>
                    Stir in sugar, a tablespoon at a time, tasting after each addition, to taste.<br>
                    (The amount of sugar needed will vary, depending on how acidic the tomatoes are.)<br>
                    Add salt to taste, and note that you will later be adding Parmesan, which is salty.<br>
                    Bring the sauce to a simmer and then lower the heat to maintain a low simmer. <br>
                    Cook for 15 to 45 minutes, stirring often. Scrape the bottom of the pot every so often<br>
                    so nothing sticks to the bottom and scorches.<br>
                    Remove from heat.</p>

                <li><strong>Boil and drain the lasagna noodles</strong></li>

                <p>By now the salted water you started heating in step one should be boiling. Add the dry<br>
                    lasagna noodles and cook them to al dente, per package directions.<br>
                    Stir often to prevent from sticking. Make sure that water remains at a full rolling boil<br>
                    during the entire cooking to prevent noodles from sticking. When ready, drain in a colander<br>
                    and rinse with cool water, gently separating any noodles that may be sticking together.<br>
                    Spread a little olive oil on a large rimmed baking sheet, and lay out the cooked noodles<br>
                    on this sheet, turning them over so that they get coated with a little of the olive oil.<br>
                    This will prevent them from sticking together.</p>

                <li><strong>Heat the oven to 375°F</strong></li>
                    <br>
                <li><strong>Assemble the lasagna</strong></li>

                <p>In a 9x13-inch casserole or lasagna dish, ladle a cup of sauce and spread it over the bottom<br>
                    of the dish. Arrange one layer of lasagna noodles lengthwise (about 3 long noodles, edge may<br>
                    overlap, depending on your pan) over the sauce. Ladle a third of the remaining sauce over the noodles.<br>
                    Sprinkle a layer of a third of the grated mozzarella on top of lasagna sauce. Add half of the<br>
                    ricotta cheese, by placing cheese dollops every couple inches. Sprinkle half the grated parmesan<br>
                    cheese evenly over the top of ricotta cheese. Apply second layer of noodles, top it with half<br>
                    of the remaining sauce. Add half of the remaining Mozzarella, the remaining ricotta cheese, and<br>
                    another the remaining Parmesan. Finish with another layer of noodles. Spread the remaining sauce<br>
                    over the top layer of noodles and sprinkle with the remaining Mozzarella cheese.</p>

                <li><strong>Bake</strong></li>

                <p>Cover the lasagna pan with aluminum foil, tented slightly so it doesn't touch the noodles or sauce).<br>
                    Bake at 375°F for 45 minutes. Uncover in the last 10 minutes if you'd like more of a crusty top or edges.</p>

                <li><strong>Cool and serve</strong></li>
                <p>Allow the lasagna to cool at least 15 before serving. Leftovers will keep for about 5 days.<br>
                    May be reheated in conventional oven or microwave. Leave aluminum tent on for storage.<br>
                    (Try to keep the aluminum foil from touching the sauce.)</p>
            </ol>
