                    <li>1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper, plus more to taste</li>
                    <li>1/2 cup dry white wine</li>
                    <li>3 tablespoons unsalted butter, divided</li>
                    <li>1 lemon, juiced</li>
                    <li>1/4 cup Parmesan, grated </li>
                    <li>4 teaspoons flat-leaf parsley, chopped</li>
                </ul>

            <h3>Steps:</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Boil water for pasta</strong></li>

                        <p>Fill a large pot with water and salt it generously.<br>
                        Set it over high heat and bring to a boil.</p>

                    <li><strong>Cook the pasta</strong></li>

                        <p>When the salted water is at a rolling boil, add the pasta.<br>
                        Cook the pasta according to the package instructions, until it is<br>
                        just 1 minute shy of al dente, very nearly cooked but slightly too<br>
                        firm in the center, about 10 minutes.<br>
                        Drain the pasta in a colander, reserving 1 cup of pasta water to add<br>
                        to the shrimp and asparagus.</p>

                    <li><strong>Cook the shrimp and asparagus</strong></li>

                        <p>While the pasta is cooking, start cooking the other ingredients.<br>
                        In a Dutch oven over medium-high heat, add the olive oil. When the oil<br>
                        is hot, add the onions and cook, stirring frequently, until it begins to<br>
                        soften, about 3 minutes. Add the shrimp, asparagus, and garlic.<br>
                        Increase the heat on the stove to high, and cook, stirring occasionally,<br>
                        until the side of the shrimp have just turned pink, about 4 minutes.<br>
                        Season with the salt and pepper.<br>
                        Reduce the heat to medium and add the white wine and 2 tablespoons of the<br>
                        butter to the pan. Bring the sauce to a simmer and cook for about 2 minutes.<br>
                        Add the lemon juice to the pan. Season with additional salt and pepper, to taste.<br>
                        Continue to cook until the asparagus is just tender and the widest part of<br>
                        the shrimp has turned from translucent to opaque, about 2 minutes.</p>

                    <li><strong>Finish the dish</strong></li>

                        <p>Add the drained pasta to the pan with 1/2 cup of the reserved pasta water<br>
                        and the remaining 1 tablespoon of butter. Cook, stirring occasionally and<br>
                        using tongs to coat the pasta with all of the ingredients in the pan.<br>
                        Stir, until the pasta is tender but still firm in the center, 1 to 2 minutes.<br>
                        You can add more of the pasta water if the pan gets dry before the pasta is done;<br>
                        you should end up with a slick of sauce coating all of the ingredients.<br>
                        Taste and adjust with more salt and pepper to taste.</p>

                    <li><strong>Serve</strong></li>

                        <p>Portion the pasta onto four plates. Top each one with Parmesan and parsley.<br>
                        Serve with a lemon wedge on the side.</p>
                </ol>
